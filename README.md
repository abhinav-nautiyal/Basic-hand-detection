# Basic-hand-detection
This module uses OpenCV and MediaPipe to detect and track hands in real-time from video input. It identifies hand landmarks, returns their positions, and draws hand connections for visualization. The module is lightweight, easy to integrate, and can be used for projects like gesture control, volume adjustment, and interactive applications.
