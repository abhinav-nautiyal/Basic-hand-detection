# Hand Tracking Module
This module leverages OpenCV and MediaPipe to detect and track hands in real-time using a webcam. It processes video frames to identify hand landmarks and returns their coordinates for further use. The module can draw hand connections on the video feed for visualization.

How to Use:

Clone the repository.
1) Install dependencies:
   pip install opencv-python mediapipe
2) Run the example script:
   python projectExample.py
